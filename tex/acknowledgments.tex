\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Filippo Sala for the invaluable support he has given me, not only in writing this thesis, but throughout the whole bachelor degree and especially in the last year filled with important decisions for my future.

A huge thanks also goes to all the professors at the University of Bologna and at University College London who fueled my passion for physics with their lectures and laboratories.

A special thought goes to all my friends and especially to the amazing people I met in Bologna and in London in the last three years: the moments I shared with them made university way more than just studying, and I will forever be grateful for this.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my brother and my sister, who are always by my side, and my parents, who have unconditionally supported my dreams since I was a kid.
